Parser Example
==============

Example demonstrating a very simple parser, with minimal optimizations, an AST
interpretor, byte code generator, and byte code interpretor.

This uses a recursive descend parser. This kind of parser is not the fastest,
but it is the clearest to understand.

```BNF
EXPR    ::= ADD_SUB
ADD_SUB ::= MUL_DIV (( "+" | "-" ) MUL_DIV)*
MUL_DIV ::= SIGNED (( "*" | "/" ) SIGNED)*
SIGNED  ::= ("+" | "-")* ATOM
ATOM    ::= IDENT | INT | PAREN
PAREN   ::= "(" EXPR ")"
INT     ::= [0-9]+
IDENT   ::= [_a-zA-Z][_a-zA-Z0-9]*

COMMENT ::= #.*$
```

**TODO:** x86_64 compiler and tests. Maybe write a different faster parser.
